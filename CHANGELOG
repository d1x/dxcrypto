Whats new in latest versions

Version 1.10
* Added ByteArrayFactory for initialization vector of CBC-based encryption algorithms
* Refactoring of Combining and Splitting

Version 1.9
* Added AES-256 and JCE checks to EncryptionAlgorithms factory

Version 1.8
* Fixed SymmetricCryptoAlgorithmBuilder block size

Version 1.7
* Removed final markers of crypto builders to allow extensions (e.g. more complex algorithms with JCE)

Version 1.6
* Fixed immutability of encryption/hashing algorithms (sharing of same Cipher/Digest instance)

Version 1.5
* Changed CombineAlgorithm interface, added SplitAlgorithm and CombineSplitAlgorithm interfaces
* Added input checks in all builders
* Fixed DigestAlgorithmBuilder.salted(CombineAlgorithm) builder method
* Changed inner structure of builders and repackaging of inner classes
* Few javadoc updates (misspelling...etc.)

Version 1.4
* Slightly improved performance of hashing algorithms
* Added SaltedHashingAlgorithm interface that is implemented by SaltingAdapter

Version 1.3
* Fixed bytes representation for salting adapter
* Removed encoding for salting adapter builder (uses encoding of adapted algorithm)

Version 1.2
* Added BytesRepresentation and incorporated into both hashing and encryption algorithms

Version 1.1
* Added SecureProperties that extend java.util.Properties and allow storing/reading encrypted properties
* Added possibility to add salting to repeating decorator
