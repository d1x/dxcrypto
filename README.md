Crypto - Java library for simple cryptography
=============================================
Set of simple tools for cryptography tools (e.g. hashing, encryption functions) built purely on Java SE
without any other dependency. Only JUnit is used for testing purposes.

Features
--------

-	Hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512
-	Encryption algorithms: AES, Triple DES using CBC (PKCS5Padding and PBKDF2 for key derivation)
